    Construct html files semantically
    Begin styling fonts
    Styling button location and arrow using flexbox
    Found another way to do this without flexbox using after pseudo element but did not go along with it because it is more tiresome and less simplified

    Debug footer. It has extra paddings on certain section and div so I took it off and reconstruct it for tablet. It is also easy to control the design in Dekstop mode.
    Update location page in tablet mode.
    I need to consider responsive design because I need to design to flow on my phone. So I need to dig in em and rem for size, padding and minmax.

    Update header for desktop site.
    Small experiement with linear gradient and mix blend mode today.

1/4/22
    Update on desktop mode for the website.
    Everything is static - mean as you increase the screen size, things will stay permanent to the top left. I will find a way to make it responsive. Just atm, to make it responsive meaning to break certain big part down which could affect the smaller components. This is not a great practice, but it can be improved over time.
